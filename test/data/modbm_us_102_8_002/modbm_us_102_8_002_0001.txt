ADDRESS BY FRANCIS LIEBER,

CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL’S COMMITTEE ON ADDRESSES, READ AT THE

MEETING BY THEIR REQUEST.

 

It is just and wise that men engaged in a great and arduous cause
should profess anew, from time to time, their faith and their resolution,
and pledge themselves to one another and to their brethren abroad to
stand by their cause to the last extremity, even at the racrifice of all they
have and all that God has given them—their wealth, their blood, and
their children’s blood. We solemnly pledge all this to our cause, for it is
the cause of our country and her noble history, of freedom, and justice,
and truth—it is the cause of all we hold dearest on the earth—we profess
and pledge all this—plainly, broadly, openly, in the cheering time of suc-
cess, and most fervently in the day of trial and reverses.

We recollect how, two years ago, when shameless arrogance, attacked
Fort Suter, the response to that boom of treasonable cannon ‘was read,
in our city in the flag of our country—that floating piece of poetry—wa-
ving from every steeple and school-house, from City Hall and Court
House, from every shop window and market stall, and fluttering in the
hand of every child and on the head-gear of every horse in the busy street.
Two years have passed; uncounted sacrifices have been made—sacrifi-
ces of wealth, of blood, and limb, and life—of friendship and brotherhood,
of endeared and hallowed parents and sacred ties—and still the civil war
is raging in bitterness and heart-burning, and still we make the same pro-

ion, and still we pledge ourselves firmly to hold’on to our cause and
persevere in the struggle into which unrighteous men, bewildered by pride
and stimulated by bitter hatred, have plunged us.

We profess ourselves to be loyal citizensof these United States ; and by loy-
alty is meant a candid and loving devotion to the object to wnich any loyal
man—a loyal husband, a loyal friend, a loyal citizen—devotes himself. We
eschew the attenuated arguments derived by trifling scholars from slim
etymology. We take the core and substance of this pregnant word, and
pledge ourselves that we will loyally——not merely outwardly and formally,
according to the letter, but fervently and according to the spirit—adhere and
cling to our country, to her institutions, to freedom, and her power, and
to that great institution called the government of our country, founded by
our fathers, and loved by their sons and by all right-minded men who have
become citizens of this country by choice and not by birth-—who have
wedded this country in the maturity of their age as verily their own. We
pledge ourselves as national men devoted to the nationality of this great
people. No government can wholly dispense with this loyalty, except the
fiercest despotism ruling by naked intimidation; but as a republic stands
in greater need of it than any other ‘government, and most of all a re-
public beset by open rebellion and insidious home-treason, loyalty is a
pre-eminent civic virtue ina free country. It is patriotism cast in the
grateful mould of candid devotion to the harmless government of an
unshackled nation.

In pledging ourselves thus we know of no party. Parties are unavoidable
in free countries, and if they acknowledge the country as desirable far above
themselves and remain within the sanctity of the fundamental law which hedges
in and protects the enjoyment of liberty prepared for all within its sacred do-
main. But party has no meaning in far the greater number of the highest
and the lowest relations in human life. When we are ailing, we do not take
medicine by party prescription. Wedo not build ships by party meas-
urement; we do not pray for our daily bread by party distinctions; we do
not take our chosen ones to our bosoms by party names, nor do we eat or
drink, sleep or wake, as partisans. We do not enjoy the flowers of spring,
nor do we harvest the grain by party distinctions. We do not incur punish-
ments for infractions of the commandments according to party creeds ; and
we do not, we must not, defend our country and our liberty, dear to us as part
and portion of our very selves, by party divisions. Woe to him who does.
When a house is on fire, and a mother with her child cries for help at the
window aboye, the dark volumes of smoke rising up from the windows
beneath her, shall the firemen at the engine be allowed to trifle away the
precious time in party bickerings, or is then the only word—“ Water!
pump away ; up with the ladder !’”

Let us not be like the Byzantines, those wretches who quarrelled about
contemptible party refinements, theological though they were, while the
truculent and ruthless Mussulman was steadily drawing nearer—nay, some
of whom would even go to the lord of the crescent, and with a craven
heart would beg for a pittance of the spoil, so that they would be spared,
and vent their party hatred against their kin in blood, and fellows in re-
ligion.

We know of no party in our present troubles; the word is an empty
word. ‘he only line which divides the people of the north runs between
the mass of loyal men, who stand by their country, no matter to what
place of political meeting they are used to resort, or with what accent they
utter the language of the land, or what religion they profess, or what coats
they may wear, or what sentiments they may have uttered in the excite-
ment of former sharp discussions, on the one hand, and those on the other
hand who keep beyond that line—outside of it—who are traitors to their
‘ country in the hour of need, or those who allow themselves to be misled
by shallow names, and by reminiscences which cling around those names
from bygone days, finding no application in a time which asks for things
more sterling than names, and theories, and platforms—which asks for
facts and deeds, for fight and death.

If an alien enemy were to land his hosts on your shores, would you fly
to your arms and ring the toesin because your country was in danger, or
would you meditatively look at your sword and gun and spend your time
in pondering whether the administration in power, which must and can
alone direct the defence of your hearths, has a right to be styled by this or
that party name, or whether it came into power with your assistance, and
will appoint some of yours to posts of high honor or comfortable emolu-
ments? And will any one now lose his time and fair name as an honest
and brave citizen, when no foreigner, indeed, threatens your country, at
least not directly, but far more, when a reckless host of law-defying men,
heaping upon yon the vilest vituperation that men who do not leave be-
hind them the ingenuity of civilization when they relapse into barbarism,
can inyent—when this host threaten to cleave your country in twain,
to split your very history, to deprive you of your rivers which God has
given you, to extinguish your nationality, to break down your liberty and
to make that land—which the distributor of our sphere of geography has
placed between the old and older world as the greatest link of that civilization
which is destined to encircle the globe—to make that land the hot-bed of an-
gry petty powers, sinking deeper and deeper as they quarrel and fight, and
quarreling and fighting more angrily as they sink deeper? It is the very
thing your foreign evemies desire and have long desired. When nullifica-
tion threatened to bring about secession—and the term secession was used
at that early period—foreign journals stated in distinct words that Eng-
land was deeply interested in the contest ; for nullifivation might bring on
secession, and secession would cause a general disruption—anfoccurrence
which would redound to the essential benetit of Great Britain.

But the traitors of the North, who have been so aptly called adders or
copperheads—striking as these reptiles do more secretly and deadly even
than the rattlesnake, which has some chivalry, at least, in its tail—believe,
or pretend to’ believe, that no fragmentary disruption would follow a divis-
ion of our country into North and Sou. and adyocate a compromise by
which they pretend to believe that the two portions may possibly be

reunited after a provisional division, as our peddlers putty a broken china
cup.

As to the first, that we might pleasantly divide into two comfortable
portions, we prefer being guided by the experience of all history, to follow-
ing the traitors in their teachings. We will not hear of it. We live in
an age when the word is nationalization, not de-nationalization; when fair
Italy has risen, like a new-born goddess, out of the foaming waves of the
Mediterranean. All distinction is quick and easy; all growth and
formation is slow and toilsome. Nations break up, when they break, like
splendid mirrors dashed to the ground. They do not break into a number
of well-shaped, neatly framed, little looking-glasses. But a far more
solemn truth even than this comes here into play. It is with nations as
with families and with individuals. Those destined by nature to live in the
bonds of firm friendship and mutual kindliness, become the bitterest and
most irreconcilable enemies, when, once fairly separated in angry enmity,
in precisely the same degree in which affection and good-will was intended
to subsist between them. We must fave back the South, or else those
who will not reunite with us must leave the country; we will and must
have the country at any price. If, however, a plain division between the
North and the South could take ce will deny that those very trai-

tors would instantly begin to work tovards a gradual annexation of the

North to the South? It is known to be so. Some of them, void of all
shame and honor, have avowed it. hey are ready to petition on their
knees for annexation to the South, and to let the condescending grantor,
‘‘holding the while his nose,” introduce slavery, that blessed ‘corner
stone of” the newest “ civilization,’”’ into the North, which has been purged
from it. Let us put the heel on this adder and bruise all treason out of
its head.

As to the compromise which they purpose, we know of no compromise
with crime that is not criminal itself, and senseless in addition to its being
wicked. New guarantees, indeed, may be asked for at the proper time,
but it is now our turn to ask for guarantees. They will be guarantees of
peace, of the undisturbed integrity of our country, of law, and liberty, and
security, asked for and insisted upon by the Union men, who now pledge
themselves not to listen, even for a moment, to the words, compromise,
new guarantees for the South, armistice, or convention of delegates from
the South and North, as long as this war shall last, until the North is victor-
ious, and shall have established again the national authority over the leneth
and breadth of the country as it was; over the United States dominion as
it was before the breaking out of the crime, which is now ruining our fair
land, ruining it in point of wealth, but, with God’s help, elevating it in
character, strength, and dignity. ‘

We believe that the question of the issue, which must attend the present
contest, according to the character it has now acquired, is reduced to these
simple words: Either the North conquers the South, or the South con-
quers the North. Make up your minds for this alternative. Hither the
North conquers the South and re-establishes law, freedom, and the integ-
rity of our country, or the South conquers the North by arms, or by
treason at home, and covers our portion with degradation and slavery.

Let us not shrink from facts or mince the truth, but rather plainly pre-
sent to our minds the essential character of the struggle in which bun-
dreds of thousands, that ought to be bothers, are now engaged. What
has brought us to these grave straits ? 2: eee :

Are we two different races, as the new ethnologists of the South, with
profound knowledge of history and of their own skins, names, and language,
proclaim? Are they really fledged with the angelic wings of aristocratic
plumage, of which their own Jefferson spoke in derision? Have they re-
ally produced the names which Europe mentions when American literature
is spoken of? Have they advanced science? Have they the great schools
of the age?. Do they speak the choice idiom of the cultivated man?
Have the thinkers and inventors of the age their homes in that region?
Is their standard of comfort exalted above that of ours? What has this
wondrous race produced ? what new idea has it added to the creat stock of
civilization? It has produced cotton, and added the idea that slavery is
divine. Does this establish a superior race ?

‘There is no fact or movement of greater significance in all history of
the human race, than the settlement of this great continent by European
people at a period when, in their portion of the globe, great nations had
been formed, and the national polity had finally become the normal type
of government ; and it is a fact equally pregnant with momentous results,
that the northern portion of this hemisphere came to be colonized chiefly
by men who brought along with them the seeds of self-government, and a
living common law, instinct with the principles of manly self-dependence
and civil freedom.

The charters under which they settled, and which divided the American
territory into colonies, were of little more importance than the vessels
and their names in which the settlers crossed the Atlantic; nor had the
origin of these charters a deep meaning, nor was their course always a
pure one. ‘The people in this country always felt themselves to be one
people, and unitedly they proclaimed and achieved their independence.
The country as a whole was called by Washington and his compeers America,
for want of a more individual name. Still, there was no outward and legal
bond between the colonies, except the crown of England; and when our
people abjured their allegiance to that crown, each colony stood formally
for itself. ‘The Articles of Confederation were adopted, by which our fore-
fathers attempted to establish a confederacy, uniting all that felt themselves
to be of one nation, but were not one by outward legal form. It was.the
best united government our forefathers could think of, or of which, per-
haps, the combination of circumstances admitted. Each colony came
gradually to be called a state, and called itself sovereign, although it had
never exercised any of the highest attributes of sovereignty ; nor did ever
after the states do sv.

Wherever political societies are leagued together, be it by the frail bonds
of a pure confederacy, or by thé consciousness of the people that they are
intrinsically one people, and form one nation, without, however, posi-
tive national government, then the most powerful of these ill-united portions
needs must rule; and as always more than one portion wishes to be the
leader, intestine struggles ensue in all such incoherent governments. It
has been so in antiquity ; it has been so in the middle ages ; it has been so
and is so in modern times. Those of our forefathers who later became the
framers of our Constitution, saw this approaching evil, and they observed
many other ills which had already overtaken the confederacy. Even
Washington, the strong, calm, and tenacious patriot, was brought to the
brink of despondency. It was a dark period in our history ; and it was
then that our fathers most boldly, yet most considerately, performed the
greatest act that our annals record—they engrafted a national, couplete
and representative government on our halting confederacy ; a government
in which the senate, though still representing the states as states, became
nationalized in a great measure, and in which the House of Representa-
tives became exclusively national. Virginia, which, under the Articles of
Confederation, was approaching the leadership over all (in the actual as-
sumption of which she would have been resisted by other rapidly growing
states, which would inevitably have led to our Peloponnesian war)—Vir-
ginia was now represented according to her population, like every other
portion of the country; not as Virginia, not as a unit, but by a number of

ie

representatives who voted, and were bound to vote individually, accord-
ing to their consciences and best light, as national men. ‘The danger of
internal struggle and provincial bitterness and strife was over, and our
country now fairly entered .as an equal among the leading nations in the
course where nations like Olympic chariot horses draw abreast the swift
car of civilization. We advanced rapidly; the task assigned to us by Prov-
idence was performed with a rapidity which had not been known before ;
for we had a national government commensurate to our land and our
destiny.

But while thus united and freed from provincial retardation and entan-
glements, a new portent appeared.

Slavery, which had been planted here in the colonial times, and which
had been increased in this country, by the parent government, against the
urgent protestations of the colonists and especially of the Virginians, ex-
isted in all the colonies at the time when they declared themselves inde-
pendent. It was considered and felt to be an evil by all, which must be
dealt ith as best it might be, and the gradual extinction of which must
be wisely yet surely provided for. Even Mr. Calhoun called it in his ear-
lier days a scaffolding erected to rear the mansion of civilization, which
must be taken down when the fabric is finished.

This institution gave way gradually as civilization advanced. It has
done so in all periods of history, and especially of Christian history.
Slavery melts away like snow before the rays of rising civilization. The
South envied the North for getting rid of slavery so easily, and often ex-
pressed her envy. But a combination of untoward circumstances led the
South to change her mind. First, it was maintained that if slavery is an
evil, it was their affair and no one else had a right to discuss it or to interfere
with it; then it came to be maintained that it was no evil; then slavery
came to be declared an important national element, which required its own
distinct representation and especial protection; then it was said—we feel
ashamed to mention it—that slavery is a divine institution. To use the
words of the great South-Carolinian, whose death we deeply mourn—of
James Louis Petigru—they placed, like the templars, Christ and Mahomet
on the same altar. Yet still another step was to be taken. It was pro-
claimed that slavery is a necessary element of a new and glorious civiliza-
tion. Those who call themselves conservatives plunged recklessly into a
new-fangled theory of politics and civilization.

Thus slavery came to group again the different portions of our country
outside of, and indeed in hostility to, the national government and national
constitution. The struggle for the leadership was upon us. The South
declared openly that it must rule; we in the meantime declaring that the
nation must rule, and if an issue is forced upon us, between the South and
the North, then, indeed, the North must rule and shall rule. This is the
war in which we are now engaged—in which, at the moment this is read
to you, the precious blood of our sons, and brothers, and fathers, is flow-
ing.

Whenever men are led, in the downward course of error and passion,
ultimately to declare themselves, with immoral courage, in favor of a thing
or principle which centuries and thousands of years of their own race
have declared, by a united voice, an evil or a crime, the mischief does not
stop with this single declaration. It naturally, and by a well-established
law, unhinges the whole morality of the man; it warps his intellect and
inflames his soul, by fierce resistance to the common and simple law of
morality, with bewildering passions, with defiance to the simplest truth
and plainest fact, and with vindictive hatred toward those who cannot
agree with him. Slavery, and the consequent separation from the rest of
men, begot pride in the leading men of the South, absurdly even to the
pretence that they were to be of a different and better race. Pride begot
bitter and venomous hatred, and this bitter hatred, coupled with this love
of owning men as things, begot at last a hatred of that which distin-
guishes the race to which we belong, more than aught else—the striving
for and love of liberty. ~

There is no room, then, for pacifying arguments with such men in arms
against us, against their duty, their country, their very civilization. All
that remains for the present is the question, Who shall be the victor?

It is for all these reasons which have been stated that we pledge our-
selves anew, in unwavering loyalty, to stand by and support the govern-
ment in all its efforts to suppress the rebellion, and to spare no endeavor
to maintain, unimpaired, the national unity, both in principle and terri-
torial boundary.

We will support the government, and call on it with a united voice to
use greater and greater energy, as the contest may seem to draw to a
close,—so that whatever advantages we may gain, we may pursue them
with increasing efficiency, and to bring every one in the military or civil
service that may be slow in the performance of his duty to a quick and
efficient account.

We approve of the Conscription Act, and will give our loyal aid in
its being carried out, whenever the government shall consider the increase
of our army necessary; and we believe that the energy of the govern-
ment should be plainly shown by retaliatory measures, in checking the
savage brutalities committed by the enemy against our men in arms, or
citizens, when they fall into their hands.

We declare that slavery, the corrupting root of this war, ought to be
compressed within its narrowest feasible limits, with a view to its speedy
extinction.

We declare that this is no question of politics, but one of simple pa-
triotism ; and we hold every one to be a traitor to his country, that works
or speaks in favor of our criminal enemies, directly or indirectly, whether
his offence be such that the law can overtake him or not.

We declare our inmost abhorrence of the secret societies which exist
among us in favor of the rebellious enemy, and that we will denounce
every participator in these nefarious societies, whenever known to us. We
believe publicity the very basis of liberty.

We pledge our fullest support of the government in every measure
which it shall deem fit to adopt against untriendly and mischievous neu-
trality ; and we call upon it, as citizens that have the right and duty to
call for protection on their own government, to adopt the speediest possi-
ble measure to that important end.

We loyally support our government in its declarations and measures
against all and every attempt of mediation, or armed or unarmed inter-
ference in our civil war. 2

We solemnly declare that we will resist every partition of any portion
of our country to the last extremity, whether this partition should be
brought about by rebellious or treasonable citizens of our own, or by
foreign powers, in the way that Poland was torn to pieces.

We pronounce every foreign minister accredited to our government,
who tampers with our enemies, and holds intercourse with disloyal men
among us, as failing in his duty toward us and toward his own people,
and we await with attention the action of our government regarding the
recent and surprising breach of this duty.

And we call upon every American, be he so by birth or choice, to join
the loyal movement of these National Leagues, which is naught else than
to join and follow our beckoning flag, and to adopt for his device—

OUR COUR TRY!
