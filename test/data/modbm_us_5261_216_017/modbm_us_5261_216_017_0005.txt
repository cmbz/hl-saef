“HOW CAN I HELP TO ABOLISH SLAVERY?”

the more highly educated and accomplished, — what are they? A direct way of fitting white men for tyrants, and black men for slaves. No ; if you would teach and Christianize the nation, strengthen the American Anti-Slavery Society, the only American institution founded on the Christian and republican idea of the equal brotherhood of man, and in opposition to a church and state which deny human brotherhood by sanctioning slavery, and pull down Christ to their own level.

Thus, instead of bowing to prejudice, they conquer it.
“ Establish free-labor warehouses.” Indeed ! is that a good business calculation that leads to expend in search of the products of free labor the time and money that would make all labor free ? While wrong exists in the world, you cannot (short of suicide) but draw your every life breath in involuntary connection with it* nor is conscience to be satisfied with any thing short of a complete devotion to the anti-slavery cause of the life that is sustained by sla-
