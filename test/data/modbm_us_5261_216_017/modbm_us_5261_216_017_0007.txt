holy, to condemn you, in order that blame might awaken conscience. But the case, I trust, is different. 1 may, then, say to you, with all the confidence, nay, certainty, which is inseparable from experience, knowledge, and utter self-abnegation in the matter, Work with the American Anti-Slavery Society. Lavish your time, your money, your labors, your prayers, in that field, which is the world, and you will reap a thousand fold, now and hereafter. This movement moves. It is alive. Hear how every thing mean and selfish struggles, hisses, and dies under its influence.

I poorest Americans the Christian gentlemen of the world.
I	“ Cherish all these high feelings that becopie
1	A giver of the gift of liberty.”
