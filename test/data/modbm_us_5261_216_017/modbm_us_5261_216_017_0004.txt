ANTI-SLAVERY TRACTS.
let their bondmen go.” I marVel at this insufficient notion of the heart of a slaveholder. I wonder exceedingly at such a want of imagination. “ Not as compensation ” is well put; for what sum can compensate a monarch for his throne I This system of slavery makes the south the parent of long lines of princes. It gives to her diabolical dominions

And exclusive instruction, teaching for blacks, a schobl founded on color, a church in which men are herded ignominiously, apart from the refining influence of association with
